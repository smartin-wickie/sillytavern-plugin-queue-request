# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-25)

**Core value:** The user can line up multiple alternative replies and keep reading undisturbed; every completed generation shows up as a normal swipe page, and the chat is never corrupted.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — route-verification-spike

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (route-verification-spike) — EXECUTING
Plan: 7 of 7

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Generation route (R1 dryRun capture + own transport vs R2 native swipe + view restore) is undecided; Phase 1 spike resolves it and gates Phases 2-4.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Many ST internals are `[Recall]` and unverified until the Phase 1 spike runs against a live ST 1.19.0 instance.
- Interceptor (Vectors) parity under R1 is LOW confidence.
- Multi-tab ownership is untested; ST has no cross-tab lock.
